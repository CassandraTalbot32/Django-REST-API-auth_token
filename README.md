# Django-REST-API-auth_token
Two endpoints. One API. 

This API will retrieve a page of solid info. 
There is not yet a tangible input info form.
There are auth_tokens added to the process.
unfortuneately I ran out of time to test all possible test cases.
If I had more time to spend on it I would iron out discrepancies, I needed to link up the create policy form to make this project work well.
I also need to thoroughly test the auth_token. It worked when I ran a test on powershell:
(env) PS C:\WINDOWS\system32\django-rest-api\django\django_rest_api> python manage.py drf_create_token Cassie
Generated token 12ce78101bd8a483169975ecd1f2937ad47029a8 for user Cassie
Despite the project not being complete I have decided to turn in. It is overdue, and, my fault as I didnt realise it would require a project to be made.

I roughly spent 12hrs on this task.
